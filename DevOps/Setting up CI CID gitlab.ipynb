    "- GitLab receives a push event: When code is pushed to a GitLab repository, a pipeline is triggered.\n",
    "- Runner picks up the job: Available runners compete to pick up jobs from the pipeline.\n",
    "- Runner executes the job: The runner clones the repository, checks out the code, and executes the defined tasks.\n",
    "- Job results are reported: The runner sends the job results (success, failure, artifacts) back to GitLab.\n",

    "### Runner types\n",
